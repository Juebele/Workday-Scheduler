# Workday-Scheduler

This is an app that allows the user to track tasks that they need to complete throughout the day. It has a save functionality that keeps track of tasks in local storage. I'm trying to add some code that will change the formatting based on the current time.

This is a work in progress and the repo is subject to be updated even after the assignment is submitted.
